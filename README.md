## REST Architectural Style

Rest is an Architectural Style defined to help create & organize Distributed Systems.

Roy Fielding, an American Computer Scientist born in 1965, proposed this architectural style to interconnect distributed systems (nonhomogeneous set of systems).

Roy is one of the main authors of the HTTP protocol (the protocol upon which the entire web infrastructure is based).

In 2000, Fielding presented his doctoral dissertation, _Architectural Styles & the Design of Network-based Software Architecture_. In it, he coined the term REST, an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.

Put simply, REST (Representational State Transfer) is the Architectural Style to help create & organize distributed systems. The key word from this definition should be _style_, because an important aspect of REST is that it is an Architectural Style, not a guideline, protocol, standard, or anything that would imply there are hard rules to follow to achieve a RESTful Architecture.
