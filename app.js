// Rest is an Architectural Style defined to help create & organize Distributed Systems

// Roy Fielding an American Computer Scientist born in 1965 proposed architectural style to interconnect distributed systems (nonhomogeneous set of systems)

// Roy is one of the main authors of the HTTP protocol (the protocol upon which the entire web infrastructure is based).

// In the 2000, Fielding presented his doctoral dissertation, Architectural Styles & the Design of Network-based Software Architecture. In it he coined the term REST, an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.

// Put simply, REST(Representational State Transfer) is the Architectural Style to help create & organize distributed systems. The key word from this definition should be style, because an important aspect of REST is that it is an Architectural Style, not a guideline, not a protocol, not a standard, nor anything that would imply that there are a set of hard rules to follow to end up having a RESTful Architecture
